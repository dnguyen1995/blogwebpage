# blogwebpage

Project #1: Personal Blog Website
Each link in the Home page takes you to the Blog Page and vice versa.
I've organise all CSS and images into seperate folders.
For the CSS, I've broken it down into different sections.
(e.g style-general.css contains styling codes which applies for all pages and CSS).
I've also named it so it makes it easier to identifies which one it is applied to.
